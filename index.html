Yes, there's a way to keep "Home.html" as your file name but still have it function as the default page for GitHub Pages. You can do this by creating a simple `.htaccess` file or by configuring your GitHub Pages settings.

Here are your options:

1. **Create a `.htaccess` file** that directs to Home.html:
   ```
   DirectoryIndex Home.html
   ```
   Place this file in the root of your repository.

2. **Use a Jekyll configuration** (even if you're not using Jekyll). Create a `_config.yml` file in the root with:
   ```yml
   defaults:
     -
       scope:
         path: ""
       values:
         permalink: /Home.html
   ```

3. **Create a minimal index.html that loads your Home.html** using JavaScript (this method doesn't show a redirect):
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Your Website Title</title>
       <script>
           window.location.replace("Home.html");
       </script>
   </head>
   <body>
       <!-- This only shows if JavaScript is disabled -->
       <a href="Home.html">Click here to continue</a>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

4. **Use an HTML iframe in index.html** to embed Home.html:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Your Website Title</title>
       <style>
           body, html {
               margin: 0;
               padding: 0;
               height: 100%;
               overflow: hidden;
           }
           iframe {
               width: 100%;
               height: 100%;
               border: none;
           }
       </style>
   </head>
   <body>
       <iframe src="Home.html"></iframe>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

Option 3 or 4 would likely be the simplest for your needs. This way you keep your Home.html file as is, but visitors to your GitHub Pages site won't see a redirect message.
